## Lightweight Branch
If you want a minimal setup with easier installation and usage, consider using the [lightweight branch](https://github.com/Gavin-Roche/connect_4_AI_v1/blob/lightweight-game-version/Connect_4_AI.py):

- **No external dependencies required** and uses only the Python standard library  
- NumPy arrays and PrettyTable have been replaced with regular Python lists and simple print statements  
- Statistical analysis features have been removed to keep the code lightweight and portable
