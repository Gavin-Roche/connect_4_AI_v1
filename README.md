# Lightweight Branch
There is now a **new branch** available that focuses on a simpler version of the game:

- **No external dependencies required** â€” uses only the Python standard library  
- NumPy arrays and PrettyTable have been replaced with regular Python lists and simple print statements  
- Statistical analysis features have been removed to keep the code lightweight and portable  

If you want a minimal setup with easier installation and usage this is the branch for you
