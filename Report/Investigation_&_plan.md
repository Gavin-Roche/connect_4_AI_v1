# Investigation and Plan
I started by researching “rock paper scissors” as a game but as I researched, I found that this was purely a game of chance and involved no skill when played against a computer.  I found that sociological tricks which work on humans when playing will not work on the computers. This would, therefore, mean the game is purely a game of chance and involves no skill and I wanted a game with skill as I prefer games of skill. 
After researching many games, I finally decided on “Connect 4”. Connect 4 is a game with a 7x6 grid the chips (traditionally yellow and red) fall to the bottom of this grid using gravity. Each player takes turns inserting their chip into the grid until there are 4 chips in a row vertically, horizontally or diagonally or until the grid is full (a draw) the player with 4 in a row is the winner. It is a solve game and is always won by the first player if both players play perfect moves. The best first move is the middle column as this ensures a win if both players play perfectly. Likewise, the columns left and right will result in a draw and the other columns will cause a loss. I found a website Reference (3) with code for connect 4. This code is very different from the way I intend to make my code. I intend to make my code in a more intuitive way using simpler logic. It does not have an intelligent computer opponent like I intend mine to have. It choses random moves instead. In the end, I chose to do connect 4 over the other games as it would be a challenge and a way to improve my Python coding skills. 
 
My objectives are to produce: 
- Multiplayer mode: will be an option where players can play with another person in the room.
- Single player mode: will allow the user to play games against the computer.
- Simulator mode: will allow for the quick collection of game data.
- Statistics: will allow the user to see the graphs of the games played.
- Testing hypotheses and changing parameters options: will allow the use to test the hypotheses and change parameters to make predictions.
