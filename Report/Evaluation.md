# Evaluation
The project turned out to be very similar to what I first envisioned and I met all the objectives I set out in the investigation and plan section.

- I made a functioning game that has a multiplayer option. 
- I made a working single player mode that plays good random moves. 
- I made a simulation mode that can have the computer play itself many times to collect data.
- I made a statistics mode that graphs the data from the csv file.
- I made a mode that testing hypotheses and changing parameters this mode works an intended and graphs the data it makes. 
The artefact could be improved by adding a graphical use interface as this would make it easier and more intuitive to users and be better for most people.
 
I could also make the artefact capable of looking a few moves ahead before making a move as this would allow me to make it more difficult and add an easy, medium and hard setting.
